# git_test

Hello Odin

We might want to revisit this code later for when I forget to commit with a message. The code below changes the default editor for adding a message from Vim to VsCode... However I'm not doing this now as there are issues currently with my laptop using the "code ." in terminal

git config --global core.editor "code --wait"
